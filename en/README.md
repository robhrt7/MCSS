# Multilayer CSS

Multilayer CSS organization methodology is a guideline to structure your CSS.

Core methodology principles are based on [BEM]((http://bem.info/)) and [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) ideas. MCSS was invented in [Odnoklassniki.ru](http://corp.mail.ru/en/communications/odnoklassniki) (Top 10 world social network) developers team and is recommended for other developers as core for own documentation and team based methodologies.

Documentation is still being constantly improved, along with secondary tools, such as front-end documentation engine [Source](http://sourcejs.com). Originally documentation was written in russian and not all information is translated yet, but in upcoming updates all contents will be translated and main project language will be changed to english.
